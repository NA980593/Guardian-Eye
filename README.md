## Overview
Sextortion is a form of blackmail where perpetrators threaten to release explicit images or videos unless their demands (often for money or further explicit content) are met. Unfortunately, teens are particularly vulnerable to this type of cybercrime due to their high levels of online interaction and sometimes limited awareness of digital safety.

In recent years, sextortion has become an increasingly common issue among teenagers, with reports showing a troubling rise in cases. It is a serious and growing threat that Guardian Eye aims to address by providing teens with the tools and knowledge to recognize, avoid, and report sextortion attempts.

The website serves as a resource for:

1. **Teens at Risk** – Individuals who are vulnerable to falling victim to sextortion due to their online activity.
2. **Parents and Guardians** – Those who are looking for tools to protect their children from digital exploitation.

The platform aims to:

- Provide teens with immediate alerts if they are targeted by a sextortion attempt.
- Offer educational resources to help both teens and their guardians understand the risks and how to prevent them.
- Facilitate secure and confidential communication for teens to report incidents and receive professional support.
- Integrate an AI-powered chatbot that offers guidance and emotional support for victims of sextortion.
